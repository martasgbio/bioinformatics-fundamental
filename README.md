# 🧬 Bioinformatics Fundamentals

This repository contains a collection of introductory and intermediate bioinformatics
pipelines developed as part of my training and professional portfolio.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical skills in biological data analysis,
pipeline design, and reproducible research using Python and Bash.

## 🛠  Pipelines Included

### 1. Basic FASTA Sequence Analysis

**Location:** `pipelines/basic_analysis/`

This pipeline performs an exploratory analysis of DNA sequences in FASTA format, including:
- FASTA statistics (length, GC content)
- GC content analysis using a sliding window
- ORF (Open Reading Frame) detection

This pipeline demonstrates:
- Sequence parsing
- Basic genomic feature analysis
- Modular pipeline design

---

### 2. Variant Analysis

**Location:** `pipelines/variant_analysis/`

This pipeline performs a basic analysis of genetic variants from a VCF file, including:
- Parsing variant information
- Basic variant statistics
- Summary of SNPs and indels

This pipeline serves as an introduction to variant processing workflows and provides
a foundation for future extensions such as cancer genomics.

## 🛠  Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Bash
- Biopython
- Matplotlib
- Git & GitHub

## 🎯 Motivation
This repository is part of my effort to build a solid and transparent bioinformatics
portfolio, with clean code, clear documentation, and reproducible analyses.

Future extensions will include:
- Variant annotation and filtering
- Cancer-related mutation analysis
- Metagenomics and metatranscriptomics pipelines
